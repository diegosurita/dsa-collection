# Reverse String  (in-place)
- LeetCode: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/description/

## Solution
This problem was resolved using the **Two Pointers Algorithm**.
- Time Complexity: O(n)
- Space Complexity: O(n)

## Real-World Usage
- **Bioinformatics and DNA Sequencing:** In genetics, DNA is double-stranded and runs in opposite directions. To find specific patterns or genes, scientists often need the **Reverse Complement** of a DNA sequence.
- **Data Compression and Encoding:** Some of the most famous compression algorithms use string manipulation as a precursor to making files smaller, such as, Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT) and Efficient Storage.
- **Symmetric Cryptography:** Many encryption algorithms (like **AES**) use "rounds" of data scrambling. While they don't just "flip a word," they do utilize bit-reversal and byte-shuffling.
- **Technical Workarounds (The "Display" Hack):** sometimes, string reversal is used to solve quirks in how data is presented, like, Right-to-Left (RTL) Languages and File Extensions.
